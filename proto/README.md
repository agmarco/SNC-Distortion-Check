# Prototypes

## Setup

We are using ipython notebook for prototying the algorithms.

You can start the prototype server by running

    jupyter notebook

you will then be able to navigate to the notebook you want to open.

## Git filter

In order to avoid committing the output of these notebooks, a [git
filter](https://github.com/kynan/nbstripout) is automatically setup as part of
the build process that filters out the unwanted parts of the notebooks.

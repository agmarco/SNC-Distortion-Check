    "This formulation assumes that $g$ is a function of the radial distance from the isocenter (i.e. it is spherically symmetric).  This seems most natural given that the error tends to increase with distance from the isocen, however given that the MRI machine is not spherically symmetric, it may also be worth considering shapes for $g$ that are no spherically symmetric.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is not clear what the proper form for $g$ should be.\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest shape for $g$ would be a sharp cutoff beyond some distance.  This shape would weight all points within the cutoff equally.\n",
    "\n",
    "Probably a better shape for $g$ would be a montonically decreasing function that is derived from the expected error (and thus expected confidence) of the points as a function of their distance from the isocenter.\n",
    "\n",
    "The rest of this notebook investigates the simple form of $g$--namely a $g$ which is a 1 for points below a threshold distance and 0 otherwise.  For this function, the main question is what should the cutoff be?\n",
    "\n",
    "Low cutoff distances will ensure distorted points do not contribute to the registration.\n",
    "\n",
    "High cutoff distances may be more stable, and errors and noise in the central points will be less able to cause bad rotatations and scaling; this is because points further from the center will counter balance and averge out errors that may be in the points in the center."
